NOTES
 



DONE
- figure out how to write to output files
- Finish A* implementation
	- figure out how to keep track of total path cost (or WAIT no actually it's greedy isn't it?)
- do i need a reset function to set all the nodes in the graph to "unvisited" after each search function? (if -all)
- figure out how to trace path
- figure out why resetgraph isnt working
- okaaay so i cant have a dictionary of paths because lists aren't hashable
	- i switched to a dictionary of explored nodes that map to their g costs

- debug
	- they dont workkkkkkkkk
- figure out correct way to extend queue?
- can't a node have a different cost depending on which path it's in?
